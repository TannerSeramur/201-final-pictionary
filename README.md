# 201-final-pictionary

## Comprised of team members: Pablo Rosales, Scott Currie, Tanner Seramur, and Shalom Belaineh

## Description:
Codefellows Bootcamp course 201's final project for our group will be a web application that mimics the classic family game Pictionary. The project should interpret the rules of the game and be able to execute them in a manner that would be similar to the original experience. To do so we require at least two players and one sill draw, and the other will guess. The drawer will receive a word and once they click *start* the drawer will have one attempt, in a set amount of time to draw the randomly selected word. After the drawer runs out of time the application will instruct the drawer to hand it to the guesser. Once the guesser has control, they can click start where the drawing will be played back and the guesser has a field to input their guess of the drawing/word. The timer will be set for the same amount of time the drawer had, and every guess will immediately tell you if it is correct or incorrect. If the guesser fails to submit the secret word for the drawing within the time interval, they lose. If they guess correctly the game will tell you that you have won!

## Problem Domain:
The main challenge was primarily understanding the rules well enough and having the ability to translate them into technical requirements for our web application.

## Daily Log

### Day 1 (Monday)
* Standup with John and Amanda. Talked about our plan for the morning.
* All team members whiteboarded the basic layout of the site. We ran through the expected experience of starting a game, adding teams, and playing through a round of drawing and guessing. We defined the framework for an MVP and determined that some of our suggested features would become stretch goals.
* Pitched project proposal to John and Amanda. Got the go-ahead to start working.
* Came up with the high level view of how labor will be divided.

### Day 2 (Tuesday)
* Worked on the starting page to get the flow of a UX experiance. Building the functionality of it piece by piece still.
* Made the game, & team constructors as well as the objects and their methods. 
* Added event listeners/handlers to manipulate the behaivior of the site.
* Picked a color scheme to be our style to use for the rest of our project.
* Demonstrated to instructors our demo.

### Day 3 (Wednesday)
* Implemented the team select page
* Implemented the code to show and hide content divs
* Started grouping loose code into functions
* Got basic timing functionality working
* Demonstrated MVP to John at the end of the day


### Day 4 (Thursday)
* Made changes to the way the timers work
* Troubleshooting bugs
* Improved styling and polish
* Reached code completion in the afternoon
* Did practice demo for TA's

### Day 5 (Final day, Friday)
* Making last styling changes based upon feedback from T.A's
